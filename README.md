# What is this?
It`s a simple file explorer which alows you to see info about folder, file or image.

# What is special about it?
* It's using MVVM structure
* It's using templates and controls
* Every element in the tree displays their own windows icon
* Dynamically switching type of control based on type of selected file in the tree
* Format file size for easy display
* You can open every element in the tree by context menu and if you don't have standard program for this it will prompt you "Open with"
* I have done it by myself
